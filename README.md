As humanity travels to extraterrestrial bodies, the need for human or robotic explorers to determine their location on the surface will be critical. Lighthouses offer a simple solution as line-of-sight navigational beacons. An important measurement for lighthouses is geographic range, the maximum visible, line-of-sight distance between an observer and the lighthouse before the lighthouse is obscured by the horizon due to the curvature of the surface. The surface traveling distance corresponding to the geographic range is crucial for planning fuel and oxygen supplies to ensure an accurate—and safe—return to base stations.

Your team is to write a program that computes the maximum surface distance that allows for a line-of-sight between an observer and a lighthouse. Your program is to assume that exoplanets are spherical with a known radius.
